# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to ShopLoc. This guide describes how we work so that the history stays clean and every change is reviewed.

## Workflow

1. Pick a ticket in Jira (for example `SHOP-12`) and move it to **In progress**.
2. Create a branch from `develop`:
```bash
   git switch develop
   git pull
   git switch -c feature/SHOP-12-product-list
```
3. Work in small commits.
4. Push the branch and open a **pull request** into `develop`.
5. Wait for the CI to pass and for **one approval**.
6. Merge with **Squash and merge**, then delete the branch.

Never push directly to `main` or `develop`.

## Branch names

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Feature | `feature/<KEY>-short-description` | `feature/SHOP-12-product-list` |
| Bug fix | `fix/<KEY>-short-description` | `fix/SHOP-30-stock-negative` |
| Documentation | `docs/short-description` | `docs/add-readme` |
| Maintenance | `chore/short-description` | `chore/update-dependencies` |

## Commit messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```text
<type>(<scope>): <short summary> [<JIRA-KEY>]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `ci`.

Examples:

- `feat(catalog): add product list endpoint [SHOP-12]`
- `fix(stock): reject negative quantities [SHOP-30]`
- `docs: add README and contributing guide`

Write the summary in the imperative, in English.

## Pull requests

- Keep them small and focused on one topic.
- Fill in the pull request template.
- Link the Jira ticket.
- The CI must be green before the review starts.
- Reviewers check readability, tests, security, and the environmental impact of the change.

## Code quality

- Run `./mvnw verify` before pushing.
- Add or update unit tests for every behaviour change.
- Do not commit secrets, passwords, or tokens.
- Fix issues reported by static analysis, or explain in the pull request why they are accepted.

## Use of AI tools

Team members may use AI assistants, including to write code. The rules below keep the repository clean.

- **AI agent files must not be committed.** Files that belong to an AI tool and have nothing to do with the application (instructions, memory, prompts, conversation exports, agent settings, for example `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/`) stay out of the repository. They are listed in `.gitignore`.
- **You are responsible for everything you commit**, whether you wrote it or an AI helped. Read it, understand it, test it, and be ready to explain it during a review.
- AI-assisted code goes through the same rules as any other code: pull request, tests, static analysis, and review.

## Reporting a problem

Open an issue describing the expected behaviour, the observed behaviour, and the steps to reproduce.
